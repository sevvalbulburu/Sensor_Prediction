### INTRODUCTION
- The study employs a robust dataset composed of sequential observations from various sensors placed across different rooms within a hotel. This dataset also incorporates information regarding the occupancy of each room over time. After undertaking the required preprocessing tasks and appropriately structuring the data, the data is prepared for further analysis. Subsequently, various predictive models are engaged, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, and Decision Trees, for an in-depth understanding of the dataset's features. To ensure transparency and comprehensibility of the processes, data visualization techniques are adopted at every stage of the analysis. This meticulously prepared introduction outlines the fundamental aspects of the research methodology, aimed at fostering a detailed, systematic approach to sensor data in the hospitality industry.
